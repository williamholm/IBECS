# IBECS
IBECS is an Entity Component System that stores component data in vectors that can be accessed via entity types which are an analouge to structs in standard C/C++
# Requirements
c++ 20, has only been tested on MSVC but nothing should be specific to it.
# How to Use
add all .hpp files not in the Test folder to your project and then include EntityManager.hpp in any file that you wish to use the ECS
## Adding Components
```c++
//comenmt
```
explain sort options
## Adding Entity Types
```c++
//comenmt
```
code
## Using EntityManager
code
explain best case / pitfalls
# Credit
